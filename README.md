This repository contains programs used to generate the plots in "Cumulative dose responses for adapting biological systems"

For figure 3 (average of three experiments) and Figure 6 (separate experiments cDR and DR), simply run:
 dushek_data_individual_left_scale_drop_unmeasured.m
which in turn calls
 dushek_high.csv
For Figures 4 and 5 (examples of simulations) see 
 cdr_plot_fig4.m
and
cdr_plot_fig5.m
Python code is provided for figures 8,9 and 10.
